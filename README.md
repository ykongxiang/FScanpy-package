# FScanpy
## A Machine Learning-Based Framework for Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting Prediction

FScanpy is a comprehensive Python package designed for the prediction of [Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting (PRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribosomal_frameshift) sites in nucleotide sequences. By integrating advanced machine learning approaches (Gradient Boosting and BiLSTM-CNN) with the established [FScanR](https://github.com/seanchen607/FScanR.git) framework, FScanpy provides robust and accurate PRF site predictions. The package requires input sequences to be in the positive (5' to 3') orientation.
